/*
  Matching text the way a shop owner types it.

  A plain `haystack.toLowerCase().includes(query)` looks fine until someone
  searches for a size. "Small 12-pack" does not contain the string "12 pack",
  because of the hyphen, so the one product they were looking for is the one
  that does not come back.

  Punctuation is therefore stripped from both sides before comparing, and the
  query is split into words that must all appear somewhere — so "relaxer big"
  finds "Relaxer" in its "Big 6-pack" size, in either order, and "12pack",
  "12-pack" and "12 pack" are the same search.

  Deliberately not fuzzy. Guessing at typos would start returning products the
  owner did not ask for, and in a list of prices and stock counts a wrong match
  is worse than no match.
